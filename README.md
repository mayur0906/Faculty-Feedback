Faculty-Feedback
================

A stand alone program, designed for BMS College of Engineering, to allow students, to provide feedback, to the faculty handling their classes.

The program must be opened in NetBeans, to execute, and make changes. Instructions to do so, can be found [here.]("https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#clone)

The .sql file, will be added soon.
